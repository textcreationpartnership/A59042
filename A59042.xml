            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Sad and Lamentable ACCOUNT OF THE Dreadful FIRE That happen'd on the Fourteenth of this Instant <hi>April,</hi> 1690. IN THE MEUSE NEAR WHITE-HALL. WITH <hi>The Circumstances that attended that Amazing Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, the Damage sustain'd thereby, and how it was happily Extinguished; with other Matters Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereto,</hi> &amp;c. <date>
                  <add>17. April .1690.</add>
               </date>
            </head>
            <p>NOtwithstanding the many fatal Consequences of Carelesness and Negligence, by which most Dreadful Fires are occasioned, to the loss of many Lives, and the ruin of whole Families; yet we see they are not of Force to caution People to be more careful, though their own Lives are at Stake, and the Fortunes, if not Lives of their Neighbours, as has too fatally been proved; but amongst other Instances, we give you here one Dreadful and Amazing.</p>
            <p>It so happened, that on the fourteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1690. Some Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad late near <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> espying in a Coffee-house a more than usual Light, supposed at first it might only be Candles, but that encreasing, they found themselves mistaken, and that it could be no less than a Fire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Alarmed the People, and the Watches taking the Alarm, did the like on their Stands, so that the Streets and Yards became full of People; yet not so soon, but that the Raging Element had gotten the Mastery, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the upper Timber, the Roof instantly falling, began to blaze terribly, and before the Engines could come up, it had caught hold of another House; all that the People could do, being to save their Lives, [some of them through Surprize, Fear and Amazement, in a manner naked,] and all People, though at a great Distance, perceiving how the Fire got Mastery, fell to Removing, every one endeavouring to save what they could; for the Houses
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42207:2"/>in those parts being many of them Old Buildings, gave them Apprehensions of a larger Progress than through Providence this Fire made; however though the Engines played vigorously, and the Soldiers especially, signalized themselves extreamly well in helping to extinguish it, it still raged on and proceeded to an adjacent Pile of Buildings, though several People were advantageously planted to secure them by continual casting on Water; but the Fire assisted by the Dryness of the Season, derided their indefatigable Endeavours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Meuse</hi> where the King's Principal Stables are, being on the Back-side of the Place where this Fire was, all hands were used to prevent its Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that Side, and the Horses were removed in great hast and hurry, to prevent the Danger that threatned them; but this was not done without great Damage, for the Fire now having burnt violently for the Space of two Hours, began to spread it self that way, giving more and more Apprehensions of Danger. But by this time many Engines being brought, and a great Multitude of hands assisting, it began by degrees to lessen; and the Fury abated, being stopped in its Progress by a vacancy, by which it was brought under, so that the fear of its dreadful Effects began to lessen, which had not only allarmed the Inhabitants adjacent, but put the Court into some Consternation.</p>
            <p>The Damage sustained by this Fire is very considerable, for by its surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing hastiness in its Progress, those whose Houses are consumed and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, especially a great part of them, had not the Leasure to carry off their Goods, or at least any considerable Quantity of them, so that some who could count themselves well setled, and considerably Rich some hours before, now found themselves outed of all. The Houses and Goods burnt are held to be worth about Ten Thousand Pounds: The <hi>Meuse</hi> Gate-house is sunk in the Flame, and other Apartments.</p>
            <p>Divers Persons are missing, and render it doubtful whether they have escaped perishing in the Flames, or are overwhelmed by the fall of the Ruines.</p>
            <p>This deplorable Accident has raised a general Compassion for the poor Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for whose Relief, Care no doubt will be taken, especially such on whom it has been so considerable, that without a great Providence they are rendred incapable of recovering their former Figures in the World.</p>
